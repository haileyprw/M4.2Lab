# M4.2 Lab

This is a refresher project for CSS in which we take an HTML file and apply CSS rules to the stylesheet to match that of the directions.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```
This will install the necessary dependencies for the project.

## Development

It is recommended to use the VSCode Live Server extension to run the project
locally. This will allow you to see changes in real-time as you make them. There
is no need to run a build process or refresh the page manually. Additionally,
you do not need to setup a local server to run the project. Depending on the width of your screen, the images may appear stacked on top of one another in a single column. If this is the case, expand your screen.

## Testing

There are no tests for this project other than visualization.
